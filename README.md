# Toolz

A collection of small AI utilities. The repository includes a simple web UI that can be hosted with GitHub Pages. The rebuilt UI suggests code snippets from a small template library so no API key is required.

## Running the site

1. Place your files under the `docs/` directory so GitHub Pages can serve them.
2. Open `docs/index.html` in the browser (or enable GitHub Pages in the repo settings).
3. Type a description of the tool you'd like and click **Generate Tool** to see a matching code snippet.
4. Use the **Copy Code** button to quickly copy the snippet.
