# Toolz

Toolz is a collection of lightweight, AI-powered browser tools for crypto investors. Each tool is completely client-side and requires no dependencies or backend.

## Available Tools

- **Ponzology** â€“ analyzes tokenomics descriptions for potentially predatory or unsustainable patterns. Visit [docs/ponzology](docs/ponzology/) to try it.

The project is designed so new tools can be added easily under the `docs/` directory. Simply create a folder for your tool containing an `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.
